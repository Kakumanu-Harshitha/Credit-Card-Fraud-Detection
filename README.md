# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
Description: Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data using classification algorithms. The project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and training models such as Random Forest and Decision tree Classifier Evaluated models using precision, recall, ROC-AUC score, and confusion matrix. Key Highlights:

Conducted EDA to understand transaction patterns.

Applied feature encoding and scaling techniques.

Used SMOTE to address severe class imbalance.

Evaluated using classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

Achieved a significant boost in fraud detection recall after resampling.
